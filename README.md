# ft_printf
*Because putnbr and putstr aren’t enough*

![100/100 score](./ft_printf_success.png)

My own implementation of system´s printf for **42 Madrid coding school** march 2020

Manages the following **conversions**: cspdiuxX%.

Manage any combination of the following **flags**: -0.\* and minimum field witdh.

## Usage
Use as you would use system´s printf.

## Extra
There is a *make test* rule on the makefile to test ft_printf against memory leaks and to test if the types are handled correctly.

The test is located in /test folder and is just a main, in case you would like to use to test your own ft_printf.

Contains more than 700 use-cases to look for leaks.

Enjoy!
